1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Indentification

    This release is a collection of Perl modules that extend the
    capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The system is the Perl programming language software. The system does
    not have any hardware. The Perl programming language contains two
    features that are utilized by this release:

    1   Program Modules to extend the languages

    2   Plain Old Documentation (POD) that may be embedded in the language

    These features are established by the referenced documents.

    The Test::Tester module extends the capabilities of the Test module as
    follows:

    *   Compare almost any data structure by passing variables through
        *Data::Dumper* before making the comparision

    *   Method to skip the rest of the tests upon a critical failure

    *   Method to generate demos that appear as an interactive session using
        the methods under test

    The Test::Tester module is an integral part of the US DOD SDT2167A
    bundle of modules. The dependency of the program modules in the US DOD
    STD2167A bundle is as follows:

     Test::TestUtil
         Test::Tester
            DataPort::FormDB
                Test::STDmaker ExtUtils::SVDmaker
